Mobile Antenna Data Mapper is an app that allows users to view data from mobile antennas in a map. The app collects data from mobile antennas and displays it in a map, allowing users to easily visualize the data.

The app allows users to view data from multiple antennas at once, and to filter the data by type, location, and other criteria. The app also allows users to compare data from different antennas, and to export the data to other applications.

The app is designed to be easy to use, and to provide users with a comprehensive view of the data from mobile antennas. It is a great tool for anyone who needs to analyze or visualize data from mobile antennas.

## Actually not xD

I was playing around with ChatGPT and needed a README file for this app I made years ago. My prompt was lazy so you will believe this app do all those stuff, but no!, You can add your own antenna data and it will show it in a map. I have a collection of data from antennas but I'm not sure if it's legal to share.
In a few weeks this will be finnished, get along.
